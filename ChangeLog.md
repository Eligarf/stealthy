# v3.11.0
* Added French translation (thanks Tallon159)

# v3.10.1
* Handle v11 change in the door data ([#105](https://github.com/Eligarf/stealthy/issues/105))

# v3.10.0
* Fixed an inverted if/else branch when building effects for v10 vs v11. 
* PF2e: Stealthy ignores raw skill rolls and will only apply the Hidden condition as part of rolling initiative with stealth, or with an action like Hide or Sneak. The 'Seeking' effect is only applied when using the Seek action. Use of the Basic Action Macros in PF2e Workbench is highly recommended, but the relevant actions can be dragged onto your character sheet if you prefer.

# v3.9.2
* Fix differences between running locally and on forge

# v3.9.1
* Forgot to change the language json files for 3.9.0

# v3.9.0
* Fixed up v11 warnings and should still be v10 compatible.

# v3.8.0
* PF1: Spot/Hidden effects are now buffs.
* PF2e: Rolling stealth (including initiative) sets the hidden condition and tracks the check result internally in a flag. If the hidden condition is set via the token HUD, its value will default to the Stealth DC of the actor.
* PF2e: Rolling a perception check (excluding initiative) adds a 'Seeking' PF2e effect to the actor which tracks the check result.
* PF2e: Hidden/Seeking doesn't yet affect the canvas - this is a work-in-progress

# v3.7.0
* Add persistance to the active spot setting

# v3.6.1
* Handle the case where the source of vision in dnd5e doesn't have a perception skill for whatever reason.

# v3.6.0
* Add Foundry V11 support
* Small tweak of Friendly Spot behavior menu language

# v3.5.0
* Only add duration to default Spot effect if combat is active, allowing one to bank spot checks out-of-combat rather than just using the passive Spot value. Spot effects coming from CE or CUB are unaffected, taking whatever duration is specified in the supplied effect.

# v3.4.0
* If multiple controlled tokens are selected, hidden doors will display if at least one token would be able to perceive the hidden door.
* If no viewing token is selected, hidden doors will only display on the GM client.

# v3.3.0
* Add option to ignore stealth on friendly tokens until combat
* Adjust internal naming to make token and door visibility flow more similar
* Moved door and engine code into their own files

# v3.2.0
* BREAKING CHANGE! Replaced secret door detection with hidden door detection - turned out to be far easier to hide regular doors than to show secret ones. My apologies for not having figured out an automated migration path for existing findable Secret Doors. This does, however, take care of the non-responsive door icon problem.

# v3.1.3
* Updated dnd4e/dnd5e version compatibility

# v3.1.2
* Re-enable secret door detection with warning about the icon refresh bug
* Moved stealthy object from window.game to window

# v3.1.1
* Fix missing use of dimAsBright setting.

# v3.1.0
* Broadcast an update perception request after stealth is rolled
* Add API to access current hidden and spot values from the active effects

# v3.0.2
* Disabled secret door detection for now due to unintended interactions with displaying door icon changes.
* Tightened token stealth/perception input boxes to avoid overlaps (thanks LukasPrism)
* Added detection distance for secret doors

# v3.0.1
* Maintain player visibility of secret door control after interaction
* Initiate a vision refresh after changing or rolling Perception check.
* Added logging to show translated labels
* Fixed dark label localization key in settings

# v3.0.0
* Secret doors can be Stealthy too! GMs can enable Players to automatically spot secret doors by beating the door's perception DC.

# v2.4.0
* Add choice to match Foundry lighting or 5E rules for perception tests in dim lighting
* Added settings for changing localization keys for dim/dark
* PF1: Perception take-10 setting; an active Spot roll is required to reveal Hidden tokens if disabled.

# v2.3.0
* Spot and Hidden effects can have different sources.
* Spot and Hidden effect label can be customized.

# v2.2.0
* Added Brazilian Portuguese support (thanks lucaspicerni)
* Verify that CUB/CE still has the desired effect before trying to create one with them (#63). Falls back to default in these cases.

# v2.1.0
* Dnd4e supported
* Fixed bug in PF1 where it used the wrong actor source for the take-10 perception tests
* Organize keys in language file

# v2.0.0
* PF1 support - effect cleanup is macro based so buyer beware
* PF2e support parked due to active effect incompatibility
* Experimental: Converted Perception roll results into roll pairs for Spot, rolling an extra die if needed
* Experimental: Dim and Hidden conditions on viewed token applies disadvantage to Perception during visibility test

# v1.6.1
